They can be found on this site.The political debate in Denmark is not doing well; pundits and talking heads take up all TV, print, and radio.The problem with this model is that many of those people aren’t basing their comments and analyses on any solid foundation centred around a proven, scientific model. They are not what people in the U.S. would call “wonks”—political-science nerds.Another fundamental problem is that the media and punditry don’t know how an opinion poll actually works. A poll is a snapshot with a statistical uncertainty. Most “movements in the polls” are results of short-lived moods and a statistical uncertainty that can make parties vacillate in polls.The New York Times’s wonk vertical, The Upshot, explained the consequence of the statistical uncertainty brilliantly in this article.As such, it is a problem that the media don’t get that you need to analyze the development in Danish politics based on a trend, and not by going from one poll to the next. You’ll keep seeing polls presented in the media as a bar chart—not a trend line over time. A bar chart at that, which doesn’t display the statistical uncertainty either.As of this writing, a panic has seized the Danish media world and British politics, because YouGov presented a poll showing more Yes votes than No votes to Scottish independence. Meanwhile, Sam Wang is estimating the probability of a Scottish No to be 95%—based on an aggregate of polls.There are several reasons why the American development towards a scientifically-informed political discourse didn’t come from the major new organisations, but from individuals with an academic background. One reason is that the media in Denmark tend to collaborate with a single polling institute; e.g. DR with Epinion and TV 2 with Megafon. It constrains them to basing their coverage on their own polling institute; meanwhile, the rest of us are free to include all public polls and draw a trend from them, which yields a more accurate picture:We all deserve to participate in the political discussion, and by making polling data public, we can contribute to a salience sorely missed in the Danish coverage of politics.So start using the polls here.American Examples The Monkey Cage Nate Silver &amp; FiveThirtyEight Sam Wang The UpshotSwedish Examples Swedish Polls Botten Ada (Swedish) trefyranio (349)Great Books The Gamble (free, downloadable chapters here)", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/07/27/48/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "July 27, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-07-25-50": { "title": "A Double Standard for Street Harassment of Muslims and Jews Does Not Go Unnoticed", "author": "Charles Onyekuru", "category": "latest news", "content": "It would be be less than a month, before the Danish People’s Party’s Pia Kjærsgaard would go from trivializing the harassment of Muslim women with headscarves while chastizing the women for provoking the reactions in one blog post to crying foul in response to reports of harassment of Jews wearing kippahs in Denmark in another.1She writes August 11th: Obviously, it’s different with Muslims—where the women are allowed to wear scarves, burka, and niqab.

He was on the train heading for a written exam on the subject of the War on Terror for his course on American history.As this was the kind of test you have 24 hours to prepare for, operating on three to four hours of sleep, Ceran was still going through his book on 9-11 on the ride towards his destination. Nervous about the impending exam, he locked eyes with a fellow passenger by Nørreport train station and attempted a smile, but knocked over his luggage case which contained the printer he had to bring for the exam.The woman he had clumsily attempted a smile at was, apparently, so distraught by the experience that she called the police to tip them off to what she perceived as “suspicious behaviour”. The police found her a “very credible” witness and kicked everything into gear.Once more, here is the police’s version of how events transpired in their final press statement on the false alarm: This morning, Copenhagen Police received a report of a person in a train who exhibited suspicious behaviour. After the police’s assessment of the report, it was decided to start a search for the person, as we wanted to clear up what was behind the behaviour. The police concluded that the witness was very credible and takes such reports seriously. - We have nothing but good reason to praise [/applaud] the reporter for being alert and for doing the only right thing, which is to contact the police about their observations. It creates a feeling of safety in the society that the citizen wishes to aid the police, says vice chief superintendent Claus Hjelm Olsen, who lead today’s police operation. - We are aware that a massive police presence can create a certain discomfort, so we found it important to inform the population about what the background was, says Claus Hjelm Olsen. Copenhagen Police’s massive effort had the intent of uncovering whether there was a criminal situation. When the wanted person was identified and approached, it turned out that it was a case of a perfectly legal situation, and the search was called off. - We have received great help from the population, who’ve reacted appropriately during the situation. Based on our use of Twitter, we received great tips in our Service Centre. Huge kudos [/applause] to the public and the wanted’s family for their way of handling the situation. The wanted person, too, has handled all the ruckus with an understanding of the police’s reaction, and we want to emphasize that he in no way was known by the police already, says Claus Hjelm Olsen.Interviews—Once Everything Had Calmed Down Danish Radio (DR) TV 2 Berlingske Tidende Interviewer: Are you shocked that so little from your side of the train could set off so much? Ceran: Not really. I think a lot of people assume the worst about people like me. That people who look like me and have a beard like me are probably terrorists. There are probably many who don’t know a single person who looks like me. I can understand that the woman was a little scared[.] Politiken Interviewer: You weren’t thinking about how your behaviour might appear suspicious in the train? Ceran: Not at all. But I have a beard and a dark appearance. In the media, it’s always people like me who are the extremists. I will say, though, that if I actually were a terrorist, why would I be sitting and reading a book about it, but not carrying out the attack instead? Interviewer: Does it make you think that you shouldn’t be sitting and reading a book on terror the next time on the train? Ceran: I will try to be more careful with my demeanour and talk to people around me, so they don’t fear that something is amiss. And give them a smile. And what of the police? Ceran had to lock himself into a accessible toilet as a precaution against people who might attempt a citizen’s arrest on him—or worse. From here, he called the police himself to set the record straight. Below is an excerpt of Politiken’s interview with police commissioner Thorkild Fogde. Interviewer: When you get a hold of [the former suspect], will you give him an apology? Police: “No, I don’t believe we have anything to apologize for. But I am going to explain to him why we react the way we do, so he has an understanding of it. But I don’t believe the police should apologize for taking the safety of the population seriously. It is our job, and even there was no terror threat in the specific case, we are not going to get around how there is an increased threat level against Denmark in general these years”, says Thorkild Fogde.", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/07/21/The-unconventionall-history-of-the-nwangele-river/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "July 21, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-07-21-daunting-ineualities": { "title": "The Daunting inequalities faced today in modern archiac society", "author": "Charles Onyekuru", "category": "latest news", "content": "My internship with wikimedia officially kicked off on the 3rd of december 2019. I had a chat session with my mentor where my project tasks were outlined. My first task was to work on pages that weren’t completed during the contribution period. I started working on my first task and so far I’ve been able to work on three pages, create 3 PRs and currently working on the fourth one. The journey so far has been a lot easier for me, thanks to the reports and resources from my mentor, but that’s not to say that I haven’t encountered some challenges.Major Challenge Faced So FarThe major challenge I think I’ve faced so far is working with git. I have worked with git in the past but not like I’ve had to within this past few weeks on this project. My issue with git started during the contribution period when I had to rebase my changes with the upstream master, there was a lot of back and forth between me and my mentor because she couldn’t merge my pull request due to the conflicts. All these back and forth and time wasting happened simply becuase I was ashamed to tell my mentor that I had issues with git especially since it wasn’t an issue with the project itself. I thought it would make her look down on me but I was wrong. This issue took me days to resolve and after trying all I could, I just opted to delete my branch and create a clean branch to work on. At that time I was happy and relieved since I had found a way to get rid of the problem, but the truth is I didn’t fix the issue I only found a way around it, which wasn’t sustainable because I can’t keep deleting branches whenever there’s a merge conflict but I didn’t think of this at that time.I came across the same problem after I started my internship, and since I only bypassed it the first time, I couldn’t solve it, my commits kept increasing trying to resolve conflicts that still resurfaced when my mentor tried to merge, It was like I was going in circles, I was stuck again, and I couldn’t delete my branch again like I did initially so this time, I sought for help from my mentor. We had a chat session where she put me through merging commits, rebasing my branch with the upstream master and from this session I got to see all the errors I was making and fixed them. I also made sure to note down all the commands we used for future reference. And that was how I was able to solve a problem I had battled with for days in just few minutes with the help of my mentor.Lesson LearntNobody is perfect, just as no man is an Island. I could have saved so much time if I had simply just asked for help from my mentor or the community when I encountered difficulty in fixing the issue the first time, but I didn’t. There is no shame in making mistakes and facing challenges, it’s a something everyone at the top has passed through and can relate to, and the best thing to do when such situations happen is to fix them and learn from them so you don’t make those mistakes or face those challenges again and even if you do or encounter someone else facing the same challenge which is possible, fixing it wouldn’t be a problem.Another improtant lesson learnt is do not take shortcuts. As a developer, I know how frustrating challenges and bugs can be especially when you are on a timeline, and how tempting it can be to take the easier route which in most cases, is just a workaround and not exactly a solution to the problem. Yeah, it may seem better at the moment but the truth is most times, these solutions aren’t sustainable and can even lead to even more bugs to manage, thereby wasting more time and resources. So my advice will be to ask questions, research and don’t stay glued to your screen for long hours trying to solve the same problem because at some point you start to try the same things over and over again, expecting to get a different result and when you don’t, you get dissapointed. So instead of working long hours at a stretch, take breaks, when you get back you might be able to look at things a bit differently and when you finally fix that bug, issue, mistake, challenge or whatever it may be, document everything. Do not just assume you have known it and can’t forget, be sure to put down your findings so when you or anyone else passes through the same issue, you can pass your solution on to them easily and save yourselves a lot of time.", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/07/21/Daunting-ineualities/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "July 21, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-07-07-lga-chairman-initiates-inspection-committe": { "title": "LGA chairman initiates inspection committes", "author": "Onyeka Ngozi", "category": "latest news", "content": "My internship with wikimedia officially kicked off on the 3rd of december 2019.

I’m really amazed at what I’ve been able to achieve within this short period of time with the help of the community and guidance from my mentor.Looking for a job, internship, a grant, a volunteer position, or some type of other opportunity ?I’m currently looking for full/part time job opportunities that will help me build a career in software development and also be able to improve developer experience. These opportunities could be remote and non-remote. Working remotely with Wikimedia has given some experience working remotely with a team and I must say, I enjoyed the flexibility that came with it. I am also open to relocating, if the need arises.Types of work I would love to contribute to / skills that would help me wiith such work ?I would love to contribute to projects that involve software development, improving developer experience, technical writing and documentation.During my internship with Wikimedia, I worked on documentation improvements to most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki, this project had me testing mediawiki action APIs with different scenerios and writing sample codes in different programming languages to come up with concise API documentations for these APIs. My drive for this project was majorly knowing the fact that while working on the API documentation, I was helping in my own little way, to improve the experience of developers making use of those APIs. My technical writing skills have improved from writing technical documentations, to blog posts and reports, I have more experience in building developer friendly APIs and writing Clean Code. Having to work remotely with a community using a collaboration tool called phabricator has also improved my communication skills.Before my internship with Wikimedia, I went through a Developer Academy Program hosted by Interswitch Nigeria LTD (a digital payments and commerce company in Nigeria). This program lasted for 8 months where I went through series of training in Software Development, particularly building Enterprise Applications.The first four months comprised of indepth classroom training on courses such as algorithms and data structures, design patterns, springboot and .net frameworks, quality assurance and software testing, and legacy systems etc. Followed by one month practical project where I built a Voucher microservice application using Java (Spring boot), C#(.NET Core), Mongodb and other tools and finally 3 months internship working with a team.During my three months internship, I worked with the developer relations team where I worked on series of tasks which include software development, technical writing, documentation, research, carrying out surveys and onboarding programs for new engineers.These internships have helped me build technical skills in software development, technical writing, developer relations, and soft skills in communication, being a team player, using collaboration tools and working remotely.Tools or skills would you like to learn?I would love to learn and explore software testing and devOps.Interpersonal skills that make me a collaborative team member ?I respect every member of my team(junior and senior), their opinions and their views. I am open to new ideas and believe in creativity. Having to work within a community and with a mentor during my internship also improved my communication skills. The project also helped improved my ability to connect with people through writing articles and blogposts.To summarize it all up, I have learnt alot while working with the mediawiki team and I intend to keep improving myself even after the internship. I’m really excited about moving on to the next phase of my career and seeking opportunities that will expand my knowledge and skills. Considering the knowledge gained and skills acquired from this internship and previous experiences, I am convinced that I’ll be a valuable employee to any company that’s lucky to have me.

My project was initially divided into two sections, the first part was to improve 20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki which was to last 8 weeks starting from the 3rd of December when the internship officially kicked off while the second part of the project was to develop a bot that mass edits sample code from mediaWiki-api-demos repository to the API namespace on MediaWiki.org and vice-versa and this was estimated to take 4 weeks. A couple of timelines and tasks have changed due to un-forseen circumstances and some tasks taking longer than anticipated but in all I’m excited about all I’ve been able to contribute so far and the knowledge gained while doing so.Goals and Accomplishments So farSo far I’ve been able to improve 14 Mediawiki Action API pages and submit pull requests for Sample codes in Python, Javascript, PHP, and MediawikiJS for each of these pages. Links to Mediawiki action pages I’ve worked on and Pull requests can be found on my Mediawiki user page ZaycodesWhat project goals took longer than expected and Why?Improving the Mediawiki action API pages took longer than expected and this happened because I under-estimated the amount of work to be done. During the contribution phase I improved 2 pages, working on these pages was not so tedious for me because there was already some information on the existing page that I could work with and also guide me through testing the APIs so I assumed that the remaining pages were going to be the same, however I was wrong. During the community bonding period when I was putting together pages that I was going to improve, I discovered that some pages had little or no information to work with, so I had to do more research on these pages and test the APIs thoroughly so I could document all possible scenerios. such pages ended up taking longer time to work on than the estimated time. Lastly, everyone struggles, therefore i’ve also had some challenges such as git which also caused some delay.What would you do differently if you were starting the project over?I would definitely do more research on the work that’s to be done before submiting my timelines, I would not just assume and under-estimate tasks especially when I have to work with tools I’ve not used before. I would also ask more questions when I’m not sure about tasks before making time commitments.Which original goals needed to be modified?The second part of my project to develop a bot that mass edits sample code from mediaWiki-api-demos repository to the API namespace on MediaWiki.org and vice-versa was replaced with improving additional Mediawiki action pages instead.My new plan for the second half of the internship?To improve as many Mediawiki action pages as I can, I’m more used to the tools and environment than I was when I started so I believe I’ll be able to work on more pages in the second half of the internship all things being equal.", "url": "/np-site//feature/2020/06/27/modifying-expectations/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "June 27, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-06-27-welcome-to-nwangele-post": { "title": "My Experience Applying to Outreachy", "author": "Onyeka Chris", "category": "latest news", "content": "Outreachy is an internship program that helps women and people who are under-represented get more invloved with open source through remote internships. Outreachy provides a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.The Application ProcessWhen I first heard of outreachy I was skeptical because I had very little experience in open source. I decided to do some research. After series of research on outreachy and reading the reports and success stories of ex-interns, I was convinced within me that this was the breakthrough I needed to break out of my shell and get more involved in open source.So I subscribed to Outreachy’s mailing list to get a notification when applications would open and started getting more involved in open source contributions as I was really motivated by all the success stories I had read at this point.Fastforward few weeks later I submitted my initial application and was ecstatic when it was approved. This took me to the the second phase which is the contribution phase.Contribution PhaseSelecting a ProjectThe contribution phase kicked off on 1st of October and lasted for about a month. It came with the dilemma of selecting a project from the numerous list of projects to contribute to. I wanted to make contributions to at least two different projects to increase my chances of getting selected. I went through all the projects and read their descriptions and required skill set to find a project that matches my skillset and where I knew I could make a difference. I was happy when I came across Mediawiki’s project Documentation improvements to the ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki. Wikipedia has always been a primary source of content when carrying out any research for me, from solving school assignments to undergraduate thesis, to post-graduate studies, my software-development career and even getting information on the fly. Though I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before, although I have worked on improving documentation for an organization before and managed their engineering blog, I decided to take a leap of faith by applying with the mindset that even if I didn’t get accepted, I will have the opportunity to contribute to improving the experience of thousands of developers who utilize Mediawiki’s API and be able to give back to the community that has helped me by so doing. So with that mindset, I chose wikimedia and my contribution phase began.ContributingAfter selecting my choice project, I went through all the available resources, registered on the communication platform which was zulip, created a phabricator account and a mediawiki account. I introduced myself on zulip -MediaWiki’s communication channel- to other members and also to the mentor assigned to me (Brenda Jerop).Then came the time to actually put in some work. A phabricator page was created for us (applicants) with a list of micro-tasks to work on. Things like API documentation page improvement were included in the tasks. I picked my first task which became my first contribution and started working on it. To be honest it was all overwhelming at first as most of the technologies were a bit new to me. But then there was something very important I learnt from this phase, which is fact that communication is key. I asked my mentor for guidance whenever I got stuck or was confused coupled with the fact that mediawiki had a lot of resources to help including blog posts and reports of past interns, all you had to do was just look.I was so excited when I created my first pull request but even more ecstatic when it was merged. I was able to submit three pull requests during the contribution period with one work in progress. Somewhere in between contributions, I drafted out my final application and submitted it to my mentor to review. Then I submitted on outreachy.One great advice I got for this contribution phase, which I’m happy I took was to start contributing early. At first it might seem like you have enough time but depending on the organization and project you are working on and how familiar you are with their process, you might need some time to understand the tools and process. For me, even though I had worked on similar projects outside wikimedia, I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before and their processes and tools were slightly different, so starting early gave me enough room to get used to all these.Getting Selected as an Outreachy Wikimedia InternOn the 26th of November 2019, I got the most exciting news that I had been selected as an Outreachy intern for Wikimedia. I was excited that I didn’t give up before I even started simply because I thought it wasn’t for me. So I will be working on the project: Documentation improvements to the ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki.I’m really excited to be working for Wikimedia, it feels like a dream come through and I also look forward to working with my mentor and the Wikimedia community to be able to contribute my own little quota to this wonderful foundation.", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/06/27/Welcome-to-Nwangele-Post/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "June 27, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-06-03-52": { "title": "Ascendendant Danish People's Party Finds No Sympathy for Harassed Danish, Muslim Women", "author": "Julia Kehnkha", "category": "latest news", "content": "In a letter published in the Danish newspaper Politiken on July 11th, Aya Baram shares her experience of living in Denmark for sixteen years as a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf.An excerpt of her experiences reads: I have been punched on the street, after which I’ve been told to “take my f… scarf of”. The police wouldn’t even press charges, because my husband was my only witness. I have witnessed an entire bus yelling that they would vote for the Danish People’s Party and get the Muslims out of the country, because a girl with a scarf happened to hold the seat in front of her, when the bus turned, whereby she touched another girl’s hair. I have had a guy suddenly let loose on my then-three-months-old nephew’s stroller with punches and kicks, after which another guy abused my sister with words like “terrorists” and other choice words, spat her in the face at a packed Nørreport [Train] Station, while everyone watched without helping. The only remark we got was from a couple who told my crying sister “but they didn’t mean it personally”.The crux of her article beyond sharing her stories from living sixteen years as a Muslim in Denmark is to encourage Muslim women to speak up for themselves, and not let others speak on their behalf.The full translation of her letter can be read here.After Baram’s letter, Politiken went on to do a follow-up article.The Danish People’s Party RespondsNot one to pass on an Islam-related discussion, Pia Kjærsgaard from the—aforementioned—Danish People’s Party (DPP) chimed in with an entry on her blog1.But before we get to her comments, some background on Kjærsgaard and her party in the context of Danish politics today.Today’s Danish People’s PartyThe nationalistic DPP is no niche party nor a group of people riding a political wave; the party is currently trailing the two largest coalition parties, polling in the low 20s, compared to the 12.3% it managed at the last election.It has never polled higher, since it was founded in 1995 by Pia Kjærsgaard and entered parliament in 1998. Kjærsgaard was the party leader, until 2012, when she passed the torch to Kristian Thulesen Dahl. She then relegated herself to the position of the party’s spokesperson on values.Recently, the euroskeptic party emerged victorious in the election to the European Parliament, where they doubled their MEP seats from two to four with 26.6 per cent of the vote, sweeping the nation as the biggest party in the election.The DPP are currently in the opposition to the incumbent government, but an impending change of administration seems a done deal in light of how the opposition has lead in every single poll since the last election in September 2012, aside from one intermittent bump in the road in May–June that soon petered out.Said bump, a scandal surrounding Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the leader of the opposition’s biggest party, Venstre, has suddenly eroded Venstre’s dominance in polls and levelled the playing field between the party and the DPP.The Danish People’s Party are no longer in a position of tipping the balance of power in Denmark; they now are contenders for claiming it for themselves.Pia Kjærsgaard’s Blog EntryReturning to Kjærsgaard’s entry in which she does not mince words on her position on the plight of Danish Muslim women.She begins This Friday, [Danish newspaper] Politiken reported how Muslim women who wear headscarves felt overwhelmingly subjected to persecution, rudeness, and jeers on the street. I personally have never experienced such a thing, nor have I ever heard anyone talk about it, so perhaps the extent has been slightly exaggerated. I generally know the Danes as a well-mannered people, who, even though they do not feel great sympathy for the Muslim headscarf, naturally will not resort to foul language against the wearers of the headscarf. Those Muslim women feel provoked by the reaction their headscarves elicit. I feel provoked, too. By them and their choice of the scarf over the Danish society!And no ground is ceded in the discussion over headscarves, as Kjærsgaard ends her entry: Fact is that the scarf in all its variants is a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism and a declaration of war against women’s right to equal right and equal value. Thus, there is every reason to criticize the headscarf. Muslim women who choose the scarf must therefore not expect to smoke peace pipe with me. On the contrary. When you choose to distance yourself from the Danish society, you must also come to expect that the Danish society distances itself from your choice. This is how it is.Read the entire entry translated here.Kjærsgaard InterviewedPolitiken got a hold of Kjærsgaard for an interview. In it, they pressed her for a response to the actual subject of violence raised by Aya Baram, which Kjærsgaard had glossed over in her diatribe against the Muslim headscarf.When interviewed, Kjærsgaard continues to express empathy for the people reacting to the women in public. Interviewer: In a debate concerning violence against women with [head]scarves, shouldn’t you address the violence, which is the central topic? Kjærsgaard: Just because I haven’t written in bold type that I abhor violence, it doesn’t mean that I support it. I am writing that I feel provoked by women with scarves. That others feel provoked by these women I can understand. That they have been subjected to comments, I can understand just fine.And in closing, Kjærsgaard is unwaivering in doubling down on blaming the victims. Interviewer: You must be a victim, when you as an innocent person are subjected to violence? Kjærsgaard: Yes, but women with scarves could also just think through the situation; if they keep getting those reactions on the street, they could just take off the scarf. Then they would also signal that they want to be a part of the Danish society.Read the full interview.Further Reading Kjærsgaard decries public intolerance and harassment by Muslims in her weekly party newsletter from November 24 2003.

Nygaard got more than she ordered, when she took her two daughters to a Joe &amp; the Juice bar. She took to sharing her experience as an open letter on Facebook: I visited you in [the Fields mall] today along with my daughters. We might have been there for 30 minutes, but in the span of that half hour, we managed to listen in on a lot of exciting details pertaining to you and your colleagues’ private life. We could hear how one of you had “done” an ugly girl in the weekend, because “the girlfriend was out travelling, which meant there was some serious [f—ing] to do”. Apparently, you won’t be as picky then, and even the ugly girls can “get a piece” of yours. We could also follow how all girls entering were rated “totally nice”, “semi”, and “ok with the lights off” and other more and less flattering phrases. Photos of the aforementioned ugly girl were shared, and I heard one of you show off with how you, when you’re out at night with your friends, feel awesome treating women “as crappy as possible”. (…)1Joe &amp; the JuiceKaspar Basse founded the company in Denmark in 2002. It has become the biggest juice-bar chain in Denmark with affiliates in the U.K., Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. It was acquired in 2013 by Swedish private-equity group Valedo Partners.In the bars, customers lounge with their juices and sandwiches. All bars are heavily branded with an environment of loud music and noises, and a staff of fresh-faced men exuding a upbeat, chatty, and fratty demeanour. The branded culture is evident a menu featuring juices like “Joe’s Green Kiss”, “Sex Me Up”, and “Young Blood”2.The Abercrombie &amp; Sandwich concept has been adopted by competing juice bars such as Big Apple.The ReactionNygaard’s Facebook post sparked a fiery discussion and quickly prompted coverage all over Danish media.3Five hours after the original post, Joe &amp; the Juice responded in a hastily-scribbled Facebook comment. It was penned by Simon Nielsen, the company’s Academy Leader and Brand Police4. The statement reads5: Hi Lisa First of all, thanks for bringing this episode to our attention. Since you wrote the post, I’ve been trying to get a hold of the employees, who worked that day, to deal with the matter. I have been in touch with the manager of the bar and the employees, and it will be dealt with immediately, as we find it completely unacceptable, and it is far away from our own values for such language to be used in a bar to talk about other people like that. I am sorry that you and your daughters had to witness this, and I want to assure you it won’t happen again. We hope that you will return, and arrangements will obviously be made for a better experience on the house. Once again, many apologies on behalf of us and the boys … I’ll give them an earful, and hopefully, this will be a lesson to them. Kind regards, Simon Nielsen, Academy Leader - Joe &amp; the Juice.The exact consequences of the incident have yet to be specified. The rest of Nygaard’s Facebook post translated: It’s one thing that you ruined our meal completely with your completely ridiculous discussion of the wonderful sex, which you instead should hallow and respect, and that my girls, who still believe they’re worth as much as the boys in the kindergarten, had to listen to you rate and disrespect women in that vicious way. Another is that I assume that you all have moms, who’ve given birth to you, nursed you, and been the most important woman for the majority of your life, and if you’re lucky, you’ll have some beautiful daughters one da (when you grow up) . but try to consider what world you’ll release them into? A world full of boys like you. I forgive you, because after all, you aren’t any older. And because you apparently are so insecure about yourselves, your sexuality, and your own worth that it’s the only way you can communicate with each other. But I implore you to reconsider your conduct anyway - for your customers’ sake, for your own sake, and for your future daughters’ sake.

He was on the train heading for a written exam on the subject of the War on Terror for his course on American history.As this was the kind of test you have 24 hours to prepare for, operating on three to four hours of sleep, Ceran was still going through his book on 9-11 on the ride towards his destination. Nervous about the impending exam, he locked eyes with a fellow passenger by Nørreport train station and attempted a smile, but knocked over his luggage case which contained the printer he had to bring for the exam.The woman he had clumsily attempted a smile at was, apparently, so distraught by the experience that she called the police to tip them off to what she perceived as “suspicious behaviour”. The police found her a “very credible” witness and kicked everything into gear.Once more, here is the police’s version of how events transpired in their final press statement on the false alarm: This morning, Copenhagen Police received a report of a person in a train who exhibited suspicious behaviour. After the police’s assessment of the report, it was decided to start a search for the person, as we wanted to clear up what was behind the behaviour. The police concluded that the witness was very credible and takes such reports seriously. - We have nothing but good reason to praise [/applaud] the reporter for being alert and for doing the only right thing, which is to contact the police about their observations. It creates a feeling of safety in the society that the citizen wishes to aid the police, says vice chief superintendent Claus Hjelm Olsen, who lead today’s police operation. - We are aware that a massive police presence can create a certain discomfort, so we found it important to inform the population about what the background was, says Claus Hjelm Olsen. Copenhagen Police’s massive effort had the intent of uncovering whether there was a criminal situation. When the wanted person was identified and approached, it turned out that it was a case of a perfectly legal situation, and the search was called off. - We have received great help from the population, who’ve reacted appropriately during the situation. Based on our use of Twitter, we received great tips in our Service Centre. Huge kudos [/applause] to the public and the wanted’s family for their way of handling the situation. The wanted person, too, has handled all the ruckus with an understanding of the police’s reaction, and we want to emphasize that he in no way was known by the police already, says Claus Hjelm Olsen.", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/04/29/bisike-day-date-set-for-december-31/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "April 29, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-04-27-45": { "title": "Talk.CSS #45 We're Still Here edition", "author": "Zainab Okoye", "category": "latest news", "content": "4 years. 45 meetups.

He initially sought 75,000 ($11,000).In an interview with DR, Ceran’s lawyer reacted to the verdict: He was cleared of suspicion, but on the other hand, the exposure of him forced him to go public and clear his name in the media.About the damages awarded: We set the damages sought to 75,000 DKK, because we didn’t have any precedent. That gave the prosecution a span for meting out the damages according to they found fair.In closing, on the public prosecutor’s ruling: They believe the police were required to respond. They don’t think the police did anything wrong. On the other hand, my client endured this tort.Ceran’s lawyer believes the verdict to be principle, and that this will help others enduring a similar suspicion to seek similar damages.Related Articles “Copenhagen Police and Media Sound Anti-Terror Alarm over Woman’s Unease at Train Passenger”", "url": "/np-site//latest%20news/2020/01/27/47/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "January 27, 2020", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2020-01-27-how-the-nwangele-became-the-source-of-community-unity-among-men": { "title": "How the Nwangele River became the source of community unity among men", "author": "Onyeka Chris", "category": "latest news", "content": "My internship with wikimedia officially kicked off on the 3rd of december 2019.

And that was how I was able to solve a problem I had battled with for days in just few minutes with the help of my mentor.Lesson LearntNobody is perfect, just as no man is an Island. I could have saved so much time if I had simply just asked for help from my mentor or the community when I encountered difficulty in fixing the issue the first time, but I didn’t. There is no shame in making mistakes and facing challenges, it’s a something everyone at the top has passed through and can relate to, and the best thing to do when such situations happen is to fix them and learn from them so you don’t make those mistakes or face those challenges again and even if you do or encounter someone else facing the same challenge which is possible, fixing it wouldn’t be a problem.Another improtant lesson learnt is do not take shortcuts. As a developer, I know how frustrating challenges and bugs can be especially when you are on a timeline, and how tempting it can be to take the easier route which in most cases, is just a workaround and not exactly a solution to the problem. Yeah, it may seem better at the moment but the truth is most times, these solutions aren’t sustainable and can even lead to even more bugs to manage, thereby wasting more time and resources. So my advice will be to ask questions, research and don’t stay glued to your screen for long hours trying to solve the same problem because at some point you start to try the same things over and over again, expecting to get a different result and when you don’t, you get dissapointed. So instead of working long hours at a stretch, take breaks, when you get back you might be able to look at things a bit differently and when you finally fix that bug, issue, mistake, challenge or whatever it may be, document everything.

Wikis are often, but not always, editable by any visitor to the site.WikimediaWikimedia is the collective name for the Wikimedia movement, revolving around a group of inter-related projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote and others, which aim to use the collaborative power of the Internet, and the wiki concept, to create and share free knowledge of all kindsWikipediaWikipedia is a Wikimedia project that is a global, free and multilingual internet encyclopedia. It is the oldest and largest Wikimedia project, predating the Wikimedia Foundation itself. Wikipedia is often described as a wiki, but it is in fact a collection of over 200 wikis, one for each language, all running on the MediaWiki software.Now that we have cleared the air on the difference between these concepts, let’s get back to the project I’m currently working on which is MediawikiWhat problem is your community trying to solve?The MediaWiki action API is a web service that allows access to some wiki-features like authentication, page operations, and search. It can provide meta information about the wiki and the logged-in user. Several Wikimedia projects make use of this API.As of now, there are 128 pages on the Action API on MediaWiki.org. A little research was done on the state of the docs and a few problems and recommendations documented for next steps. One of the issues chosen to address was inconsistency. For example, some pages had the automated API docs embedded; some didn’t, some pages had code samples, some didn’t, etc.As a first step, a documentation template was designed and used to re-write the top 20 viewed pages of the API. But then, to improve all 128 pages, it was made open to new Wikimedia contributors for help :-) The next 60 pages were improved in the last two Outreachy rounds.The goal of this project is to improve documentation of ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki using the documentation template.How does Mediawiki fit into the larger community?The MediaWiki software is used by tens of thousands of websites and thousands of companies and organizations. It powers Wikipedia and helps collect and organize knowledge and make it available to people. It’s powerful, multilingual, free and open for others to use (and improve), extensible, customizable, reliable, and free of charge.The site, mediawiki.org, is intended for information about MediaWiki and related software.Besides Wikimedia sister projects, many other sites exist that are using MediaWiki engine. Such sites based on Mediawiki software generally display the Powered by icon near the bottom right corner of their pages. Some examples include AIDS Wiki, Apple 2 Games, Bitcoin Wiki, Bible Strength and many more.Why would people want to use your project?MediaWiki is an extremely powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation that uses PHP to process and display data stored in a database, such as MySQL. Pages use MediaWiki’s wikitext format, so that users without knowledge of HTML or CSS can edit them easily. When a user submits an edit to a page, MediaWiki writes it to the database, but without deleting the previous versions of the page, thus allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming. MediaWiki can manage image and multimedia files, too, which are stored in the filesystem. For large wikis with lots of users, MediaWiki supports caching and can be easily coupled with proxy server software. With dedicated extensions, MediaWiki can also handle structured data.What makes you most excited to work on your project?The fact that while improving the documentation to MediaWiki Action API pages in my cubicle, I am also improving the experience of thousands of developers who utilize Mediawiki’s API and also having the opportunity to collaborate with the great minds behind the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) and improve my skills while doing so.What new terms or concepts have you learned in the past month?I’ve learned Wiki editing, using mediawiki templates, creating and managing translatable pages and also how to use the Wikimedia Phabricator tool.What was confusing to you about the project?Well I’ll say at first creating and managing translatable pages and adding translation tags to my sandbox pages before pushing to the main page was quite confusing but with the help of my mentor and going through resources on translating pages, I am well past that confusion now.My journey and experience so far with this wonderful community has been an exciting one and I’m ecstatic about the opportunity to learn and collaborate and also experiences that still awaits me.", "url": "/np-site//feature/2020/01/10/think-about-your-audience/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "January 10, 2020", "image": "" } , "feature-2019-12-28-outreachy-everybody-struggles": { "title": "Just know that Everybody Struggles", "author": "Angelina Okoli", "category": "feature", "content": "My internship with wikimedia officially kicked off on the 3rd of december 2019.

Outreachy provides a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.The Application ProcessWhen I first heard of outreachy I was skeptical because I had very little experience in open source. I decided to do some research. After series of research on outreachy and reading the reports and success stories of ex-interns, I was convinced within me that this was the breakthrough I needed to break out of my shell and get more involved in open source.So I subscribed to Outreachy’s mailing list to get a notification when applications would open and started getting more involved in open source contributions as I was really motivated by all the success stories I had read at this point.Fastforward few weeks later I submitted my initial application and was ecstatic when it was approved. This took me to the the second phase which is the contribution phase.Contribution PhaseSelecting a ProjectThe contribution phase kicked off on 1st of October and lasted for about a month. It came with the dilemma of selecting a project from the numerous list of projects to contribute to. I wanted to make contributions to at least two different projects to increase my chances of getting selected. I went through all the projects and read their descriptions and required skill set to find a project that matches my skillset and where I knew I could make a difference. I was happy when I came across Mediawiki’s project Documentation improvements to the ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki. Wikipedia has always been a primary source of content when carrying out any research for me, from solving school assignments to undergraduate thesis, to post-graduate studies, my software-development career and even getting information on the fly. Though I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before, although I have worked on improving documentation for an organization before and managed their engineering blog, I decided to take a leap of faith by applying with the mindset that even if I didn’t get accepted, I will have the opportunity to contribute to improving the experience of thousands of developers who utilize Mediawiki’s API and be able to give back to the community that has helped me by so doing. So with that mindset, I chose wikimedia and my contribution phase began.ContributingAfter selecting my choice project, I went through all the available resources, registered on the communication platform which was zulip, created a phabricator account and a mediawiki account. I introduced myself on zulip -MediaWiki’s communication channel- to other members and also to the mentor assigned to me (Brenda Jerop).Then came the time to actually put in some work. A phabricator page was created for us (applicants) with a list of micro-tasks to work on. Things like API documentation page improvement were included in the tasks. I picked my first task which became my first contribution and started working on it. To be honest it was all overwhelming at first as most of the technologies were a bit new to me. But then there was something very important I learnt from this phase, which is fact that communication is key. I asked my mentor for guidance whenever I got stuck or was confused coupled with the fact that mediawiki had a lot of resources to help including blog posts and reports of past interns, all you had to do was just look.I was so excited when I created my first pull request but even more ecstatic when it was merged. I was able to submit three pull requests during the contribution period with one work in progress. Somewhere in between contributions, I drafted out my final application and submitted it to my mentor to review. Then I submitted on outreachy.One great advice I got for this contribution phase, which I’m happy I took was to start contributing early. At first it might seem like you have enough time but depending on the organization and project you are working on and how familiar you are with their process, you might need some time to understand the tools and process. For me, even though I had worked on similar projects outside wikimedia, I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before and their processes and tools were slightly different, so starting early gave me enough room to get used to all these.", "url": "/np-site//feature/2019/12/15/the-tony-invalid-concert/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "December 15, 2019", "image": "" } , "feature-2019-12-06-voucherz": { "title": "Rise and fall of rural development in Nwangele", "author": "Angelaina Okoli", "category": "feature", "content": "A voucher generation microservice application that generates three different types of Vouchers which include Gift voucher, Value voucher and a Discount voucher and redeems these vouchers.

Now, A Breath of Snow and Ashes continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire. The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest. With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown.But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from “The Wilmington Gazette,” dated 1776, which reports Jamie s death, along with his kin.

Outreachy provides a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.The Application ProcessWhen I first heard of outreachy I was skeptical because I had very little experience in open source. I decided to do some research. After series of research on outreachy and reading the reports and success stories of ex-interns, I was convinced within me that this was the breakthrough I needed to break out of my shell and get more involved in open source.So I subscribed to Outreachy’s mailing list to get a notification when applications would open and started getting more involved in open source contributions as I was really motivated by all the success stories I had read at this point.Fastforward few weeks later I submitted my initial application and was ecstatic when it was approved. This took me to the the second phase which is the contribution phase.Contribution PhaseSelecting a ProjectThe contribution phase kicked off on 1st of October and lasted for about a month. It came with the dilemma of selecting a project from the numerous list of projects to contribute to. I wanted to make contributions to at least two different projects to increase my chances of getting selected. I went through all the projects and read their descriptions and required skill set to find a project that matches my skillset and where I knew I could make a difference. I was happy when I came across Mediawiki’s project Documentation improvements to the ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki. Wikipedia has always been a primary source of content when carrying out any research for me, from solving school assignments to undergraduate thesis, to post-graduate studies, my software-development career and even getting information on the fly. Though I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before, although I have worked on improving documentation for an organization before and managed their engineering blog, I decided to take a leap of faith by applying with the mindset that even if I didn’t get accepted, I will have the opportunity to contribute to improving the experience of thousands of developers who utilize Mediawiki’s API and be able to give back to the community that has helped me by so doing. So with that mindset, I chose wikimedia and my contribution phase began.ContributingAfter selecting my choice project, I went through all the available resources, registered on the communication platform which was zulip, created a phabricator account and a mediawiki account. I introduced myself on zulip -MediaWiki’s communication channel- to other members and also to the mentor assigned to me (Brenda Jerop).Then came the time to actually put in some work. A phabricator page was created for us (applicants) with a list of micro-tasks to work on. Things like API documentation page improvement were included in the tasks. I picked my first task which became my first contribution and started working on it. To be honest it was all overwhelming at first as most of the technologies were a bit new to me. But then there was something very important I learnt from this phase, which is fact that communication is key. I asked my mentor for guidance whenever I got stuck or was confused coupled with the fact that mediawiki had a lot of resources to help including blog posts and reports of past interns, all you had to do was just look.I was so excited when I created my first pull request but even more ecstatic when it was merged. I was able to submit three pull requests during the contribution period with one work in progress. Somewhere in between contributions, I drafted out my final application and submitted it to my mentor to review. Then I submitted on outreachy.One great advice I got for this contribution phase, which I’m happy I took was to start contributing early. At first it might seem like you have enough time but depending on the organization and project you are working on and how familiar you are with their process, you might need some time to understand the tools and process. For me, even though I had worked on similar projects outside wikimedia, I hadn’t contributed to wikimedia before and their processes and tools were slightly different, so starting early gave me enough room to get used to all these.", "url": "/np-site//feature/2019/11/15/Second-Nwangele-Post-copy/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "November 15, 2019", "image": "" } , "latest-20news-2019-05-16-40": { "title": "Talk.JS + Talk.CSS = JSConf.Asia Special!", "author": "Zainab Okoye", "category": "latest news", "content": "It’s JSConf.Asia week!

Into a way bigger one. The idea stemmed from the fact that there wasn't going to be a CSSConf.Asia this year, and we thought we'd compensate for it by expanding our January meetup.We decided to call it the max-content edition. max-content, like from the CSS grid specification? Get it? Oh, never mind. But the point was to make it a half-day event, with more speakers in the line-up. The fact that this particular meetup was part of the festivities for DevFest.Asia meant that some awesome people were going to be in Singapore anyway.Getting speakers And that's how we got Mandy Michael on our list. She had already bought a ticket to JSConf.Asia 2018, and very kindly agreed to speak at Talk.CSS as well. We also decided to make it a paid event for the first time, so we could gather up some funds to fly in one more speaker that we really wanted to have. So we managed to get Andy Clarke, who generously agreed to come over as well.Sebastiaan Deckers was a friend of the meetup, who had offered to share on one of the pony-fills he had built since last year, so we were glad he could make it on the day. Zell Liew had presented at Generate Conference earlier last year as well and we felt his topic was too practical and useful not to share. And we would have Hui Jing round off the evening with an ode to the web.Support from sponsors At the heart of it, this wasn't really a conference per se, just an expanded meetup, so we still retained its cosy, casual feel. Microsoft was very supportive of this idea and offered us a venue that could hold up to 150 attendees. Given that the average turn-out for us was about 20–30 people, we put up an ambitious target of 100 attendees.We also managed to get in touch with Wantedly, who were already involved with JSConf.Asia and they offered to sponsor the coffee vendor for the event, because nobody wants to sit through 3 straight hours of talks without a break. We couldn't offer much in terms of swag, but we could offer good coffee.Mozilla jumped in early on and really gave us the confidence to pull the whole thing off. And one other thing about the Singapore Tech community is that we are really tight-knit, and our friends from SP Digital offered to pitch in as well. With that, we were able to cover T-shirts for all attendees as well. We also got an angel sponsor, who declined to be made known, but we felt the need to recognise their contribution with a little angel logo as well.On the dayOne of the things we were quite proud of was the standees we printed for the event, because the design was done entirely in HTML and CSS. This was largely because of colour font support, or the lack of it. The only image editing software that supports colour fonts appears to be Adobe CC 2017, which we did not have access to.Colour fonts do work in Firefox and Edge though, so the standee was designed in the browser, and we sent a screenshot of the full page to the printer's. Of course in as high a resolution as they required. The end result turned out better than we expected.We also had a number of friends who volunteered to help out with the logistics of registering attendees, handing out T-shirts and so on, which made the whole event run much smoother than if it was only Chris and Hui Jing running the show.Given that the event itself was held on a Tuesday afternoon from 3–6pm, the turn-out was much better than we could have asked for, with 107 attendees showing up for the event. We are extremely thankful for every single member of the community who helped spread the word, even if they couldn't make it for the event themselves.Talk sessionsOur first speaker, Andy Clarke, kicked things off with a fantastically delivered talk on Designing Inspired Style Guides, that had attendees riveted and entertained.Sebastiaan Deckers did his lightning talk on using CSS variables to pony-fill the generic font family, system-ui, which was introduced in the CSS Fonts Level 4 specification. It was short but extremely informative.Our next speaker was Zell Liew, who spoke about building responsive CSS components, offering very practical advice on building components that could be re-used across larger sites and applications.The coffee was really well-received and also gave attendees a chance to mingle and chat while letting their minds digest all the great content from the first half of the event.Mandy Michael showcased an stunning array of CSS text effects that left everyone with their jaws hanging and amazed that it could all be achieved with pure CSS. She even introduced variable fonts, which are still new enough that not many people are talking about them yet.Finally, Hui Jing rounded off the evening with a relatively less-technical talk about embracing the web for what it is. It was essentially an ode to the web as a medium, and a call to encourage participation in shaping the web platform.All the talks were recorded by Engineers.SG and they had an amazing turn-around time, publishing the videos in less than 24 hours. They are consummate professionals in this regard, and given they are an entirely no-profit volunteer-run organisation, we were more than happy to become a Silver Tier supporter with our remaining funds.Closing remarksWe are really grateful to everybody involved, from the speakers, to the sponsors, to the volunteers, and to everyone in our community who attended, as well as those who couldn't make it, but helped us spread the word.

Chassis no. 60551, registered AX 201, was the car that was originally given the name “Silver Ghost.” Other 40/50 hp cars were also given names, but the Silver Ghost title was taken up by the press, and soon all 40/50s were called by the name, a fact not officially recognised by Rolls-Royce until 1925, when the Phantom range was launched.The Silver Ghost was the origin of Rolls-Royce’s claim of making the “Best car in the world” – a phrase coined not by themselves, but by the prestigious publication Autocar in 1907.[citation needed]The chassis and engine were also used as the basis of a range of Rolls-Royce Armoured Cars.HistoryIn 1906, Rolls-Royce produced four chassis to be shown at the Olympia car show, two existing models, a four-cylinder 20 hp and a six-cylinder 30 hp, and two examples of a new car designated the 40/50 hp. The 40/50 hp was so new that the show cars were not fully finished, and examples were not provided to the press for testing until March 1907.[2]The car at first had a new side-valve, six-cylinder, 7036 cc engine (7428 cc from 1910) with the cylinders cast in two units of three cylinders each as opposed to the triple two-cylinder units on the earlier six. A three-speed transmission was fitted at first with four-speed units used from 1913. The seven-bearing crankshaft had full pressure lubrication, and the centre main bearing was made especially large to remove vibration, essentially splitting the engine into two three-cylinder units. Two spark plugs were fitted to each cylinder with, from 1921, a choice of magneto or coil ignition.[3] The earliest cars had used a trembler coil to produce the spark with a magneto as an optional extra which soon became standard - the instruction was to start the engine on the trembler/battery and then switch to magneto. Continuous development allowed power output to be increased from 48 bhp (36 kW) at 1,250 rpm to 80 bhp (60 kW) at 2,250 rpm. Electric lighting became an option in 1914 and was standardised in 1919.[1] Electric starting was fitted from 1919[3] along with electric lights to replace the older ones that used acetylene or oil.Development of the Silver Ghost was suspended during World War I, although the chassis and engine were supplied for use in Rolls-Royce Armoured Cars.The chassis had rigid front and rear axles and leaf springs all round. Early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels operated by a hand lever, with a pedal-operated transmission brake acting on the propeller shaft. The footbrake system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913. Four-wheel servo-assisted brakes became optional in 1923.[3]Despite these improvements the performance of the Silver Ghost’s competitors had improved to the extent that its previous superiority had been eroded by the early 1920s. Sales declined from 742 in 1913 to 430 in 1922. The company decided to launch its replacement which was introduced in 1925 as the New Phantom.[4] After this, older 40/50 models were called Silver Ghosts to avoid confusion.A total of 7874 Silver Ghost cars were produced from 1907 to 1926, including 1701 from the American Springfield factory.[3] Many of them still run today. A fine example is on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.The Alpine EaglesA 40/50 was privately entered in the prestigious 1912 Austrian Alpine Trial by James Radley, but its 3-speed gearbox proved inadequate for the ascent of the Katschberg Pass. A factory team of four cars were prepared for the 1913 event with four-speed gearboxes, and engine power increased from 60 to 75 bhp (56 kW) by an increase in compression ratio and larger carburettor. The team gained six awards including the Archduke Leopold Cup. Replicas of the victorious cars were put into production and sold officially as Continental models, but they were called Alpine Eagles by chief test driver (and later Rolls-Royce Managing Director) Ernest Hives, and this is the name that they have kept.", "url": "/np-site//cars,/vintage,/sports/car/2016/10/25/rolls-royce-silver-ghost/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "October 25, 2016", "image": "" } , "meetup-2016-10-25-11": { "title": "Talk.CSS #11", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "In the double digits now and still chugging along.

Intended for racing in the new FIA GT Championship series in 1997, the CLK GTR was designed primarily as a race car, with the road cars necessary in order to meet homologation standards being secondary in the car’s design. Thus the limited production road-going cars are considered racing cars for the road.After competing successfully in 1997, the race car was upgraded in 1998 for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and renamed the CLK LM. Following the construction of the CLK LMs and the CLK GTR road cars, the project would end in 1999 by being replaced by the Mercedes-Benz CLR Le Mans prototype.Racing carCLK GTRAs the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft/International Touring Car Championship had folded in late 1996, with both remaining competitors Opel and Alfa Romeo leaving due to the high costs of their 4WD designs, Mercedes-Benz had no top series to compete in. With the success of the BPR Global GT Series leading to the FIA taking over and turning it into an international series known as the FIA GT Championship, Mercedes-Benz saw an opportunity to go against manufacturers like Porsche and Ferrari.Following the design that Porsche had laid out with their 911 homologation special, Mercedes-AMG was tasked by Mercedes-Benz with creating an extreme racing car that still maintained some elements of a normal street legal car. AMG’s designers created a car which shared some design elements with the Mercedes-Benz CLK, yet had all the standard features of a racing car underneath. A Mercedes-Benz M120 V12 engine would be at the heart of the car, mounted behind the cockpit. The bodywork would be made entirely of carbon fiber, and would feature many aerodynamic design elements and cooling openings in order to survive on the race track.To test the CLK GTR before the first chassis were built, Mercedes-AMG actually took an unusual measure. Through secrecy, Mercedes-AMG was able to purchase a disused McLaren F1 GTR, the defending BPR GT series champion, from Larbre Compétition. This purchase first allowed Mercedes-AMG to see the kind of lap times that their competitors could run, to serve as a measurement of the CLK GTRs abilities. However, more importantly, Mercedes-AMG set about modifying this F1 GTR by attaching bodywork that was meant to go on the CLK GTRs. Mercedes-Benz also used their own LS600 6.0 liter engine in place of the BMW V12 unit.[1] This allowed Mercedes-AMG to be able to perfect the aerodynamics of the car before it had even been built.Upon completion of the first two prototypes a mere 128 days after the initial drawings had been made, the CLK GTRs were entered into the 1997 FIA GT Championship season, debuting at the season-opener at one of Mercedes-Benz’s home tracks, the Hockenheimring. Unfortunately the new cars were not able to shine, as brake problems eliminated one car after five laps, and the other finished over 20 laps behind the winning McLaren. However, by the next round at Silverstone, the CLK GTR began to show its pace, finishing less than a second behind the winning McLaren. By the fourth round, returning to Germany for the Nürburgring, a third CLK GTR was added to the team. In this race, Mercedes-Benz successfully outperformed the fleet of McLarens, taking first and second places. The team would finish out the season with five more wins, at A1-Ring, Suzuka, Donington, Sebring, and Laguna Seca, allowing them to secure the team championship as well as the drivers championship for Bernd Schneider.CLK LMAfter conquering the FIA GT Championship, Mercedes-Benz set its sights on competing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998, which it had not been at since 1991. However, Le Mans presented a different challenge from that offered in FIA GT, in that the race distances were nearly one tenth the distance covered at Le Mans. Therefore, Mercedes-AMG set about altering the CLK GTR in order to meet the new demands required at Le Mans.First and foremost, Mercedes-AMG decided that the M120 V12 would not be up to the task of running for 24 hours. It was decided instead that Mercedes would actually return to an engine they had used in Group C in the late 1980s, the M119 V8. Abandoning the turbochargers that the M119 had used in Group C and enlarging the displacement, Mercedes-AMG felt that the M119 would have better reliability at speeds while still performing the same amount of power as the M120 due to air restrictor regulations.Satisfied with the engine, Mercedes-AMG also set about altering the bodywork to better cope with the high speeds of Le Mans. The nose was lowered, with the large front brake cooling ducts on the sides of the nose being removed and replaced by a single, large opening in the front of the car. The roof of the car was also lowered and a new engine air intake designed. Various other mechanical tweaks were also performed. This new car would become known as CLK LM, standing for Le Mans.Debuting at Le Mans, the CLK LMs were immediately quick. The two car team took the pole, ahead of custom built open cockpit Le Mans prototypes. However, Mercedes-AMG’s belief that the M119 V8s would be better suited to Le Mans was proven wrong as both cars suffered engine failures within the first few hours of the race, leaving Mercedes-Benz dejected.Returning to FIA GT, Mercedes-Benz replaced their older CLK GTRs with the new CLK LMs and saw greater success. The two cars easily won every remaining race, including six 1-2 finishes. This handed Mercedes-Benz the teams championship again, while Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta would share the drivers championship.For the 1999 season, no competitor attempted to enter the GT1 class in FIA GT except for Mercedes-Benz, forcing the FIA to cancel the class, similar to the DTM/ITC two years earlier. Mercedes-Benz thus turned to constructing an all-new car to overcome their failure at Le Mans. No longer forced to build a racing car that could also be a road car, Mercedes-AMG set about creating the Mercedes-Benz CLR.The CLK LM’s V8 engine produced approximately 600 hp (450 kW), allowing it to reach speeds up to 330 km/h (205 mph) in testing for the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. Mercedes-AMG claimed a virtual top speed of 335 km/h (208 mph).[citation needed] In total, four racing variant CLK-LMs were constructed and one road-going version was built to comply with the 1998 FIA regulations.", "url": "/np-site//cars,/prototype,/sports/car,/mercedes/2016/10/24/Mercedes-Benz-CLK-GTR/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "October 24, 2016", "image": "" } , "cars-prototype-sports-car-toyota-2016-10-24-toyota-gt-one": { "title": "Toyota GT-One", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Toyota GT-One (model code TS020) is a racing car initially developed for grand touring GT1 rules, but later adapted into a Le Mans prototype LMGTP car. It raced in the 1998 and 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. It is well known for being the fastest racing car to compete at Le Mans, with a top speed of approximately 420 km/h. Its road equivalent, built for homologation reasons, also bears a similar speed.HistoryFollowing the end of the Group C era around 1994, Toyota decided to alter its plans in sports car racing by moving to the production-based GT classes for 1995. Toyota decided to approach this in two ways by using two different styles of car for competition. The first was a heavily modified Toyota Supra, referred to as the Supra LM, which would use a turbocharged 3S-GT (503E) inline-4. The second entry was a custom built car designed specifically to be a racing car, yet required a small number of production cars for sale in order to meet homologation regulations. This car was modified heavily from the Toyota MR2, and became known as the SARD MC8-R. The MC8-R would use a custom built Toyota turbocharged V8. While the Supra performed admirably in 1995, the MC8-R would appear superior for 1996. With development of high powered supercars for the GT classes at the time, Toyota decided that a car similar to the MC8-R, which was intended as a race car first, would be better suited to continuing Toyota’s development of a GT car. Thus Toyota announced they would skip the 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans to be able to develop their new GT car for 1998.Turning to Toyota’s European arm based in Cologne, Germany, Toyota Team Europe (TTE) and Dallara were charged with development of the new GT car. With taking the one-year hiatus, TTE was able to look at what the competition was developing for the GT class, and exploit it to their benefit. In 1997, both the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR and the Porsche 911 GT1 were dominant cars in their class that exploited loopholes in the rules in place at the time. Each car was a custom built super car of which only a small handful of production cars were built to homologate it. TTE realized that they would actually only need to build a single production car in order to meet homologation regulations, thus allowing TTE to have a car that would never truly be sold to a customer, meaning that any driver luxuries could be left out.Second, Toyota learned about a loophole which Mercedes-Benz had exploited. All GT based cars were required to have storage space, capable of holding a standard sized suitcase, in order for the car to be considered not only production based, but usable by the public. Mercedes exploited this by putting a small cubby hole into an unused area underneath the rear bodywork, although it was not as easy to access as a normal trunk. Toyota, in their interpretation of the rules, were able to convince Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO) officials that the car’s fuel tank, normally empty when the car is scrutineered before the race, was allowable as a trunk space since it could, theoretically, hold a suitcase.With these loopholes in place, TTE was able to set out in laying-out the GT-One. TTE designed and manufactured the car’s carbon fiber chassis and bodywork in-house, while Toyota supplied a heavily upgraded version of the engine they originally used on their Group C cars, the R36V 3.6 L Turbo V8.TTE also developed the only two GT-One road cars built, required in order for the race car to qualify as a road car-based Grand Tourer. They were painted red and fitted with a basic interior. One was put into a museum in Japan, the other is displayed at Toyota Motorsport GmbH in Cologne, Germany.", "url": "/np-site//cars,/prototype,/sports/car,/toyota/2016/10/24/Toyota-GT-One/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "October 24, 2016", "image": "" } , "cars-prototype-sports-car-porsche-2016-10-24-porsche-962": { "title": "Porsche 962", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Porsche 962 (also known as the 962C in its Group C form) is a sports-prototype racing car built by Porsche as a replacement for the 956 and designed mainly to comply with IMSA’s GTP regulations, although it would later compete in the European Group C formula as the 956 had. The 962 was introduced at the end of 1984, from which it quickly became successful through private owners while having a remarkably long-lived career, with some examples still proving competitive into the mid-1990s.DevelopmentWhen the Porsche 956 was developed in late 1981, the intention of Porsche was to run the car in both the World Sportscar Championship and the North American IMSA GTP Championship. However IMSA GTP regulations differed from Group C and subsequently the 956 was banned in the US series on safety grounds as the driver’s feet were ahead of the front axle center line.To make the 956 eligible under the new IMSA regulations, Porsche extended the 956’s wheelbase to move the front wheels ahead of the pedal box.[1] A steel roll cage was also integrated into the new aluminium chassis. For an engine, the Porsche 934-derived Type-935 2.8L flat-6 was used with air cooling and a single Kühnle, Kopp und Kausch AG K36 turbocharger instead of the twin K27 turbochargers of the Group C 956, as twin-turbo systems were not allowed in IMSA’s GTP class at the time.The newer Andial built 3.2L fuel injected flat-6 would be placed in the 962 by the middle of 1985 for IMSA GT, which made the car more competitive against Jaguar. However it would not be until 1986 that the 2.6L unit from the 956 was replaced in the World Sportscar Championship, using 2.8L, 3.0L, and 3.2L variants with dual turbochargers. The cars run under World Sportscar Championship regulations were designated as 962C to separate them from their IMSA GTP counterparts. The 3.2L unit, which had been eligible under IMSA’s Group 3 engine rules, was banned by IMSA in 1987.[2] In 1988, to counteract against the factory Nissans and the threat of withdrawal from Porsche teams, water-cooled twin-turbo Porsche engines would be allowed back but with 36 mm restrictors.[2]In total, Porsche would produce 91 962s between 1984 and 1991. 16 were officially used by the factory team, while 75 were sold to customers. Some 956s were rebuilt as 962s, with two being previously written off and four others simply rebuilt. Three 962s that were badly damaged were also rebuilt had been given a new chassis number due to the extensive reconstruction.[3][4][original research?] Due to the high demand for 962 parts, some aluminium chassis were built by Fabcar in the United States before being shipped to Germany for completion. Derek Bell, a 5-time Le Mans winner, drove the 962 to 21 victories between 1985 and 1987, remarked that it was “a fabulous car, but considering how thorough (Norbert) Singer (the designer of the 962 and head of Porsche’s motorsport division at the time) and the team were, it was really quite easy to drive.” [5]", "url": "/np-site//cars,/prototype,/sports/car,/porsche/2016/10/24/porsche-962/", "imagepath":null, "baseurl": "/np-site/", "date": "October 24, 2016", "image": "" } , "cars-grand-touring-sports-car-porsche-2016-10-21-porsche-911": { "title": "Porsche 911", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or German: Neunelf) is a two-door, 2+2 high performance sports car made since 1963 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted six cylinder boxer engine and all round independent suspension. It has undergone continuous development, though the basic concept has remained little changed.[2] The engines were air-cooled until the introduction of the Type 996 in 1998, with Porsche’s “993” series, produced in model years 1994-1998, being the last of the air-cooled Porsches.[3][4]The 911 has been modified by private teams and by the factory itself for racing, rallying, and other forms of automotive competition. It is among the most successful competition cars. In the mid-1970s, naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSRs won major world championship sports car races such as Targa Florio, Daytona, Sebring, and Nürburgring, even against prototypes.
