My internship with wikimedia officially kicked off on the 3rd of december 2019. I had a chat session with my mentor where my project tasks were outlined. My first task was to work on pages that weren't completed during the contribution period. I started working on my first task and so far I've been able to work on three pages, create 3 PRs and currently working on the fourth one. The journey so far has been a lot easier for me, thanks to the reports and resources from my mentor, but that's not to say that I haven't encountered some challenges.



The major challenge I think I've faced so far is working with git. I have worked with git in the past but not like I've had to within this past few weeks on this project. My issue with git started during the contribution period when I had to rebase my changes with the upstream master, there was a lot of back and forth between me and my mentor because she couldn't merge my pull request due to the conflicts. All these back and forth and time wasting happened simply becuase I was ashamed to tell my mentor that I had issues with git especially since it wasn't an issue with the project itself. I thought it would make her look down on me but I was wrong.  This issue took me days to resolve and after trying all I could, I just opted to delete my branch and create a clean branch to work on. At that time I was happy and relieved since I had found a way to get rid of the problem, but the truth is I didn't fix the issue I only found a way around it, which wasn't sustainable because I can't keep deleting branches whenever there's a merge conflict but I didn't think of this at that time.

I came across the same problem after I started my internship, and since I only bypassed it the first time, I couldn't solve it, my commits kept increasing trying to resolve conflicts that still resurfaced when my mentor tried to merge, It was like I was going in circles, I was stuck again, and I couldn't delete my branch again like I did initially so this time, I sought for help from my mentor. We had a chat session where she put me through `merging commits`, `rebasing my branch with the upstream master` and from this session I got to see all the errors I was making and fixed them. I also made sure to note down all the commands we used for future reference. And that was how I was able to solve a problem I had battled with for days in just few minutes with the help of my mentor.
