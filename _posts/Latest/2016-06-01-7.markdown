Updates and news in the world of CSS for June 2016. Our regular segment. Topics covered available [here](https://github.com/SingaporeCSS/slides/blob/gh-pages/notes/talk-7.md).

*PSA: Unfortunately, we messed up the video recordings, and so super extra effort is required to sync the audio with the video, and our Grand Master Poobah, Michael, is simply too swamped to do it. Apologies to everyone, especially to Michael.*
