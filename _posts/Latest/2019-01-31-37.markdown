Another month, another successful Talk.CSS. You all showed up in force this time, I stopped counting at 40, so thank you all for spending your precious evening with us. Thank you to Shopee for hosting us and feeding the masses.

ICYMI, the introduction slides for Talk.CSS were upgraded to v2.0. Hilarity ensued. You had to be there.
