The first time Talk.CSS fell on Halloween and we made a marginal effort to add some spookiness to this edition. Marginal. We also announced that Chris would be moving back to Melbourne by the end of the year and were heartened by people volunteering to help out moving forward.

Turn out was pretty good this evening as well, because clearly, it's more fun to party with us on Halloween, right? Right? Hey, where are you goingâ€¦?
