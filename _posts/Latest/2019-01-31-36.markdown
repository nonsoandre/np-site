We were very honoured to be [HOOQ](https://www.hooq.tv/)'s first tech meetup. They are wonderful hosts and hopefully more tech meetups will take place at their lovely office. But we'll always be the first.

Had a lot of good CSS going on this evening. If you missed it, ah well, videos for you then. We also now have a newsletter, so [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/SingaporeCSS) to get a dose of monthly HTML & CSS news in your inbox.
