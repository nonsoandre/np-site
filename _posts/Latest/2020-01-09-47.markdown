Due to concerns over the nCoV-2019 virus, we have decided to invoke Plan V and do Talk.CSS #47 completely online. Thank you to the 4 people who dialed-in. Your presence will be forever preserved on video. ICYMI, our theme this month was clearly “Testing in Production” as Sheldon and I just live-coded stuff.

Big thanks to Michael for handling the technical setup and uploading the videos before I even ate dinner. We are now 47-in-a-row. I swear I'm not OCD.
