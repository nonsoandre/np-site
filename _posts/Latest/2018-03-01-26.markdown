We had quite a crowd this time around, but Skyscanner's conference room was more than capapble of handling said crowd. We want to thank [Ardy](https://twitter.com/wickedmanok) for helping us out with hosting, as well as his great talk. As well as [Michael](https://twitter.com/coderkungfu), who showed up in person to video us this month.
