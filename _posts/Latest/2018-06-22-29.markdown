This month was one of our less anyhowly months, with proper speakers and all! Our lovely hosts, Carousell, also sponsored healthy food, which is a nice change from the pizza everyone keeps eating at tech meetups in general. Our video recordings did NOT fail this time, so maybe we've broken the curse...for now.
