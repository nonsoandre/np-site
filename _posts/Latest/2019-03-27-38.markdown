We finally had a long overdue CodePen edition, but in addition to that, we also had one of the best talks at Talk.CSS  by [Gao Wei](https://wgao19.cc/) on CSS blend-modes. She has also been cheated onto the SingaporeCSS pirate ship as our new co-organiser. <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="women with bunny ears">&#x1F46F;&#x200D;&#x2640;&#xFE0F;</span>

Also, to everyone who volunteered for the CodePen Show & Tell, including those who dialed in from overseas. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for your patience and willingness to go along with my hare-brained schemes.

In order of appearance, the biggest thank you to Chris and Sarah Lienert (<span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Australia">&#x1F1E6;&#x1F1FA;</span>), Olivia Ng (<span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="United States of America">&#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;</span>), Ayaka Sasaki (<span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Japan">&#x1F1EF;&#x1F1F5;</span>), Ten “Tenzy” Zhi Yang, Purnima Kamath and Jay.
