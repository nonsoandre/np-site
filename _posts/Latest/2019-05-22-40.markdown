It's [JSConf.Asia](https://2019.jsconf.asia/) week! And so we're having a long overdue combined meetup with our sister meetup, [Talk.JS](https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js). The turn-out was fantastic and so were the talks. We are especially thankful to [Carousell](https://sg.carousell.com/) for stepping in at the very last minute to rescue us from logistical issues with the previous venue. And [SP Digital](https://blog.spdigital.io/) who lent us extra chairs.

We truly love this community, and the community loved us back two-fold. This event wouldn't have been possible without the support from all of you, and for that we are very grateful <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="folded hands">&#x1F64F;</span>.
