We are so glad and grateful to all of you who turned up to celebrate our 3rd birthday with us. It's hard to believe, but it's been 3 years and 34 meet-ups. We had to say farewell to co-founder, Chris Lienert. Without him, there wouldn't be a Talk.CSS to begin with. Given he'll be taking over MelbourneCSS, stay tuned for some potential international collaboration.

This was a wonderful way to end off an amazing 2018. For everyone new, welcome. For the regulars, words are not enough to express how much your support means to our little meet-up. Chris and I may have started Talk.CSS, but all of you kept it going. <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="red heart">&#x2764;&#xFE0F;</span>
